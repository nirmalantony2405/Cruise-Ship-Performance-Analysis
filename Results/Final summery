Fuel Efficiency: Since both vessels have an infinite (undefined) fuel efficiency, this metric doesn't provide insights for comparison.

Total Propulsion Power: Vessel 2 uses significantly less propulsion power (5.82 MW) compared to Vessel 1 (7.66 MW). Less propulsion power for similar operational conditions typically indicates higher efficiency.

Total Diesel Generator Power: Vessel 2 also uses less diesel generator power (10.74 MW) compared to Vessel 1 (12.59 MW), further supporting that Vessel 2 is operating more efficiently in terms of power consumption.

Conclusion:
Vessel 2 appears more efficient based on its lower total propulsion and diesel generator power consumption, which indicates it uses less power to achieve similar performance.
